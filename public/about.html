<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  My name is Dejan Jankovic. Before I became a web developer, I worked as a
  craftsman. <br />I have always loved solving problems. That is why I have
  always been highly recognised. <br />
  I decided to listen to my inner self after so many years and that is why I
  have now entered <br />
  the world of programming. I know I have a lot to learn. But I believe that
  everyone can learn <br />
  anything if they are willing to learn and are ambitious.
